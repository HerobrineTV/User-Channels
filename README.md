# User-Channels

Discontinued for almost 4 years now!
U can try it but I dont know if it still works!

To use The Auto Channel Correctly you have to add these two Events (Channel Create Event, Channel Leave Event).

Also you have to replace the stuff which is marked to replace.

You need a Category and a Creation Channel which should Look like this but the Name doesnt matter.
